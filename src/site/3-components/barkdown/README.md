# Barkdown Style

 Using mostly pseudo elements; attach common markdown syntax back to the HTML elements.

**Why would anyone do that?** Uhm, good question. It's kinda annoying.

This applies to all HTML elements within a block element with the class
`t-Barkdown`. The `t-` prefix stands for typography as it is limited to just
affecting those styles.

The index.html here is for testing. It's mainly from poormansstyleguide.
