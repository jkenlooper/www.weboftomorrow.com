# Cards on a Plane

_Card game that can be played on a plane or a train._ [Check it out at
cards.massive.xyz](https://cards.massive.xyz/)

This is a deck of cards simulation that I built to play around with. My goal
was to build something using the [vanilla javascript
framework](http://vanilla-js.com/). It also is designed to use web components
and depends on [Card Tricks](https://github.com/jkenlooper/card-tricks) which is
my other project.

This is a playground where I'm learning and implementing some web components.
I will eventually pick it up again and make it more friendly for offline use by
following a web app structure. Only concentrating on developing this in Chrome,
for now.
