<h1>Puzzle Massive - Massively Multiplayer Online Jigsaw Puzzles</h1>

<p>A web site that allows players to collaborate on jigsaw puzzles. The stack
is on Python web frameworks using a sqlite database. The front end uses
AngularJS and some web components. Real time jigsaw puzzle piece movements are
handled with websockets.

<h2>Initial development in 2011</h2>
<p>
In 2011 I had some extra time on my hands and a fun idea of creating a jigsaw
puzzle website.  Of course it had to allow players to collaborate on the same
puzzle.  This is the feature that would separate it from the rest of the online
puzzle sites I've seen.  So after a couple of months I had something that
I made public.  It worked well enough, but I didn't think it could handle heavy
traffic.  Even if I did get heavy traffic, I had nothing in place to monetize
that.
</p>

<p>
My free time was running out.  I had many ideas on making the site profitable
which I thought would be better if I just rebuilt the whole thing.  Later my
attempt at a rebuild took longer then expected.  Oops.  I decided to just stop
hosting it and move on to other things.
</p>

<h2>Bringing an old project back to life</h2>
<p>
In May of 2016 I decided to dig in to my code I wrote so long ago.  I needed to
resist the urge to just rewrite the whole thing from scratch and just focus on
maintaining it.  My first step was cleaning up the deployment process.  It was
relying on a custom build process that would fetch dependencies that were
a little too complex and fragile. I also was not as familiar with that
build/compile process anymore.
</p>

<p>As a great learning experience for me; I took an iterative approach.  First
I implemented a Vagrant file and wrote some scripts to get the web app easier
to develop on.  Next, to familiarize myself with my old code, I started fixing
minor bugs.  One was a memory leak that steadily made the pages load slower and
slower.  It felt good to fix that one. </p>

<p>After getting the app to a state that worked better; I started stripping out
half-baked features and just generally simplifying the code where I could.
I pretty much started replacing all my old javascript/jquery with just plain
javascript at this point.  Eventually, I would need to switch over to a JS
framework and figured if I could clean up my existing javascript it would make
the transition easier.</p>

<h2>Clean up the server side code</h2>

<p>The existing backend was using a custom CMS built on the tornado python
framework. This custom CMS I built before I started the puzzle project.  It's
funny to build a CMS for just your own use, but that's what I did. (This custom
CMS was not Chill. I built that much later.)  It lacked good documentation and
probably had a lot of rough edges as I was the only developer on it.  So of
course I used it as the base framework for the puzzle site.</p>

<p>My job now for the backend was to transition away from this rough custom
framework.  The first steps were to drop as many features and junk that were
no longer being used.  Not saying my features/ideas for the framework I built were
bad; just that they had little use for the puzzle site anymore.</p>

<h2>Framework decisions</h2>

<p>Maybe I'm making the same mistake again, but I decided to use my own custom
framework, Chill, for any new development with the site.  So, now the site is
split between two backends that share the data from a sqlite database.  (Yes,
I'm now running into some minor locking issues, but that is mostly how the
jigsaw piece renderer interacts with that database.) It is usually best to use
the framework that you are best familiar with. For me, Chill, which is built on
the Flask web framework, was the logical choice.  </p>

<p>
What to use as the framework for the front end?  This was actually a hard
choice.  At this point I've cleaned up a lot of my old javascript code to
depend less on jQuery.  The code was now more modular and functionality split
between files.  My choices started off at creating my own frankenstein
framework that I would just develop as I went.  I later decided against this
approach and went with AngularJS 1.5, since that is what I was using/learning
at work at the time.
</p>

<p> Getting any kind of framework to fit into an application's development will
not always be a smooth process.  Sure the tutorial and example apps that use
the framework will all make it look so simple, but real world apps (If a jigsaw
puzzle site is a 'real world' app.) tend to have their own pecularities.  For
Puzzle Massive the problem I ran into was how I incorporated the jigsaw puzzle
pieces following the 'Angular way'.  Being a developer using angular for just
a few months; I'm sure I made some rookie mistakes in my design.  To manipulate
pieces was just a too slow of a process when there were over a thousand of
them.  I knew I could do better than that.  </p>

<p>Instead of fighting with angular directives and such for the puzzle pieces,
I decided to use a web component.  The puzzle pieces logic could all live with
this isolated web component.  Since I already had a lot of javascript for the
pieces as plain old javascript it was easy to just make it work.  I also ended
up building a more generic web component 
(<a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/slab-massive">slab-massive</a>)
to handle the zooming/scaling of the whole puzzle so it could all fit on the
screen.  Hooray for web components.</p>

<h2>Ongoing development</h2>

<p>Even though I've been the sole developer on this side project of mine, I've
found it useful to create issues and milestones.  This helps so I can just
concentrate on other things knowing that I've documented that issue or
feature.</p>

<p>The project is not under an open source license since I didn't really see
much interest in other developers wanting to collaborate on it.  I have
separated out bits of the project as open source software.  Like the piece
rendering logic has been created as a separate repository on github. See <a
  href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/piecemaker">piecemaker</a> and <a
  href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/pixsaw">pixsaw</a> for how I create
random jigsaw puzzle pieces.  Also the
<a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/slab-massive">slab-massive web component</a>
I developed along side the project.  I have plans to
create a better system of 'collaborativly manipulating thousands of objects in
delayed time' which I'm hoping could be used in other projects.  Maybe
eventually the whole of the puzzle project will be itself a puzzle with each
piece being a bit of software configured to work in the web application.  Or
not.</p>
