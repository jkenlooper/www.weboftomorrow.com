# Web of Tomorrow

Source code to build the [Web of Tomorrow](http://www.weboftomorrow.com).  The
content and such is not within this repository.  The site is statically
generated by using [Chill](https://github.com/jkenlooper/chill).  It uses
a build script to create the compiled/minified css and js.   


## Testing grounds

The website is rather simple and could just be a few static files without any
fancy templating and compiling involved.  But, that doesn't scale and I like to
practice using my tools for small things so I'm better prepared for larger
projects.  

## Installing

You have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed?
Great.

    npm install 

Now install [Chill](https://github.com/jkenlooper/chill) at the
'mustached-rival' branch since it's cooler.  Chill is built on the
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web framework. 

    pip install git+https://github.com/jkenlooper/chill.git@mustached-rival


To run the site locally with some test content (All content on the
[Web of Tomorrow](http://www.weboftomorrow.com) site is stored elsewhere):

    cat test-content/db.dump | sqlite3 test-content/db
    chill run --config test.cfg

And check it out at on your machine: http://localhost:5000/test/

## Developing

The included build.sh script is used to build all the static resources like css
and js.  It is automatically run when doing the initial `npm install` command.
I like to set it to run each time a file changes by using the
[watchit](https://github.com/jkenlooper/watchit) command:

    while true; do watchit && npm run-script build; done;


## Contributing

Yeah, if you see something that can be improved, then I'd be happy to merge it
in.
