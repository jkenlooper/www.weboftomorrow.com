Source code to build the [Web of Tomorrow](http://www.weboftomorrow.com).  The
content and such is not within this repository.  The site is statically
generated by using [chill](https://github.com/jkenlooper/chill).

More documentation is available within the docs directory.

- [Local development guide](docs/development.md) for getting a local version
  running on your own machine.
- [Deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for deploying to a live server. This
  covers both in-place deployments and blue-green deployments.

The structure of this project inherits from this
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/jkenlooper/cookiecutter-website).
