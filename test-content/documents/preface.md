# Llama

They are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd. The wool
produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas are intelligent and
can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can
carry about 25% to 30% of their body weight for 8–13 km (5–8 miles).

The name llama (in the past also spelled 'lama' or 'glama') was adopted by
European settlers from native Peruvians.

Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America about
40 million years ago. They migrated to South America about three million years
ago. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were
extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas
and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the
late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the
United States and Canada.
